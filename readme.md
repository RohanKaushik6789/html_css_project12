  2. Then go to icons section in this clickble [Fontawesome website](https://fontawesome.com/)
  3. search the icon you want but takecare after search when you get result then you will find some options probably left side there choose free option so that you can choose free icon else if you select pro icon it will not work i faced this challange
  4. After clicking yout required icon copy the 'i' tag and past it in your html code's body tag .
